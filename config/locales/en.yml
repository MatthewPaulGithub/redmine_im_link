You can also use any URI that you like including Skype for Business - sip:, Slack - slack:, General Instant Message - im:, Email client - mailto:, and so on. The include and exclude strings work together to look for patterns - so normally you would list all the domains you want to include, for example your own company domain, and the domain of any associated companies that use the tracker (e.g. support staff). The exclude strings are normally used to exclude specific email addresses which you do NOT want to include - so for example, if you have generic email addresses that are not actually owned by people.'
